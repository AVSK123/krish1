## What is a pull request?
A pull request is a development process that provides a platform for discussion and review of a completed feature. Its purpose is to notify team members that the feature has been completed and it is open for discussion or modifications. The discussion usually occurs to improve the quality of the code it is basically a code review process.
## Pull request process:
* Once a pull request is created, it is open for discussion or modifications.
* Sometimes conflicts occur after creating a pull request, and you must resolve these conflicts. 
* Usually, the assigned person reviews the code, he reviews the code and give their feedback or discuss potential modifications to the code.
* Any feedback or modifications are added in the form of comments near the code line.
* The developer resolves comments and replies to the reviewer and closes resolve conversation.
* This process continues until all comments are resolved.
* Once all discussions are resolved, the code is merged to the branch that was selected when the pull request was created.
